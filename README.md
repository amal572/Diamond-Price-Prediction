- `test.csv`: the test set

## Features:

- **price**: Price in US dollars ($326--$18,823)
- **carat**: Weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

- **y**: Width in mm (0--58.9)
- **z**: Depth in mm (0--31.8)
- **depth**: Total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
- **table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point (43--95)
