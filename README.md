This is my first competition to predict model made using python on jupyter notebooks in kaggle with Shai

## Data Description:
This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization.

## Files:
<li>train.csv - the training set</li>
<li>test.csv - the test set</li>

## Features:
<li>price price in US dollars ($326--$18,823)</li>
<li>carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)</li>
<li>cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)</li>
<li>color diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)</li>
<li>clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))</li>
<li>x length in mm (0--10.74)</li>
<li>y width in mm (0--58.9)</li>
<li>z depth in mm (0--31.8)</li>
<li>depth total depth percentage = z / mean (x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)</li>
<li>table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)</li>
